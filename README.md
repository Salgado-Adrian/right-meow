## Inspiration

We are all fans of cats and were joking about how they each have different personalities, similar to how zodiac signs are believed to be. We decided to mix these two ideas and come up with a cat adopter where the cats are celebrities!

## What it does

This app shows compatability between your indicated zodiac sign and celebrity cats! You can see compatability scores from greatest least and choose to adopt if you want.

## How we built it

This was built using React for the front end and Flask for the back end. Additionally, we implemented a mySQL databse to store our information needed and fetched the information using API requests.

## Challenges we ran into

This was our first hackathon for all of us so we had problems collaborating together using Git and gitHub. Additionally, this was also our first time using mySQL as a database. We were at first using a list of dictionaries in Python to store our information, but we had decided to try out a databse for the first time to see how they work. 

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

We are proud of how we were able to link the frontend to the backend after much trial and error. We were able to figure out how API requests work and utilize them correctly.

## What we learned

We learned how important the structure of a project can be as well as many other technical things such as frameworks interacting with eachother.

## What's next for Right Meow

We would like to better our use of mySQL and modularize our frontend better.
